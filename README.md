# Sensitivity Analysis of MILP-Based Expansion Decisions Under Demand Uncertainty

## Overview
This repository presents a study on the sensitivity analysis of expansion decisions formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model under demand uncertainty. The objective is to analyze how variations in demand impact strategic expansion planning and investment decisions.

## Motivation
Expansion decisions in industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, and infrastructure planning require careful assessment of future demand variations. By integrating sensitivity analysis into the MILP framework, we aim to:
- Identify critical parameters affecting expansion feasibility.
- Quantify the impact of demand fluctuations on decision-making.
- Provide insights for robust strategic planning.

## Methodology
The approach consists of the following steps:
1. **Model Formulation**: Defining the MILP problem for expansion decisions.
2. **Uncertainty Representation**: Incorporating demand uncertainty through probabilistic or scenario-based methods.
3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluating model outputs across varying demand levels.
4. **Results Interpretation**: Analyzing the influence of uncertainty on optimal solutions.

## Key Features
- **MILP Optimization**: Utilizes mathematical optimization techniques for expansion planning.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Studies the impact of different demand scenarios.
- **Python & Pyomo Implementation**: The model is developed using Pyomo, an open-source optimization framework in Python.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of results for better interpretation.
