## 🌟 **Overview**  
Strategic expansion decisions (e.g., manufacturing capacity, supply chain networks) are often modeled as **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** problems. However, real-world demand uncertainty can significantly alter the feasibility and optimality of these plans. This project:  
- Conducts **sensitivity analysis** on MILP-based expansion models under demand uncertainty.  
- Identifies **critical demand thresholds** that impact investment decisions.  
- Provides **visual tools** to interpret trade-offs between cost, capacity, and risk.

### **Why This Matters**
Industries face volatile demand due to market shifts, disruptions, and seasonality. Many still rely on traditional tools like Excel or expert judgment, leading to uncoordinated and biased decision-making. **Traditional MILP models** assume fixed demand, resulting in:
- **Overinvestment** in low-probability scenarios.
- **Underpreparedness** for high-demand shocks.
- **Suboptimal resource allocation** due to rigid expansion strategies.

Expansion decisions in **industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, and infrastructure planning** require careful assessment of future demand variations. A real-world example is the **supply of surgical instruments**, where ensuring that the right equipment reaches surgeons at the right time requires capacity investment planning today to meet future needs some years ahead due to long lead times. However, the challenge is that the future is uncertain:
- **New product introductions (NPIs) may cannibalize existing products** at unpredictable rates.
- **Market prices fluctuate**, impacting profitability.
- **Demand patterns shift** due to technological advancements, regulatory changes, and competitive actions.

By integrating **sensitivity analysis** into the MILP framework, we aim to:
- **Identify critical parameters** affecting expansion feasibility.
- **Quantify the impact of demand fluctuations** on decision-making.
- **Provide insights for robust strategic planning** that adapts to uncertainty.

### **Research Questions**
- How sensitive are **MILP-driven expansion decisions** to demand uncertainty?
- Which **demand scenarios** lead to infeasibility or cost spikes?
- Can we derive **robust decision rules** from sensitivity analysis to improve strategic planning?

### **1. Demand Scenario Generation**
We generate multiple demand forecasts using **Monte Carlo simulation**. The simulation considers:
- **User inputs**: Nominal demand data, a set of instructions
- **Real-world dynamics**: Market potential, adoption rates (for new products (NPIs) or cannibalizationeffects), product relationship, launch delays
Scenario sampling is them performed based on cumulative probability functions to ensure comprehensive uncertainty coverage.

### **2. MILP Model Formulation**  
The next step involves formulating a **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model** with the objective of:
- **Minimizing total costs**, including inventory holding and other expenses.
- **Maximizing demand fulfillment** by ensuring optimal capacity allocation.

The model's decision variables determine how many capacity units should be allocated to different work centers over multiple time periods. This results in a **multi-period supply management problem** subject to various constraints, including:
- **Inventory balance** and demand propagation.
- **Production capacity and expansion projects.**
- **Flexible work centers** that can adapt to changing demand.
- **Annual budget limitations** and investment feasibility.

A single demand forecast can be optimized using this MILP model. 


The optimization model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) to determine optimal expansion decisions under demand uncertainty.

- Avoids the need to re-run multiple scenarios
- Determines the sensitivity of decision variables to different demand scenarios, enabling faster and more robust strategic planning.
