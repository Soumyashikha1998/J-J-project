## 🌟 **Overview**  
Strategic expansion decisions (e.g., manufacturing capacity, supply chain networks) are often modeled as **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** problems. However, real-world demand uncertainty can significantly alter the feasibility and optimality of these plans. This project:  
- Conducts **sensitivity analysis** on MILP-based expansion models under demand uncertainty.  
- Identifies **critical demand thresholds** that impact investment decisions.  
- Provides **visual tools** to interpret trade-offs between cost, capacity, and risk.  

*(Add a concise 2-3 sentence summary of your key findings here for conference attendees.)*

## 🎯 **Motivation & Problem Statement**  
### **Why This Matters**  
Industries face volatile demand due to market shifts, disruptions, or seasonality. Traditional MILP models assume fixed demand, leading to:  
- **Overinvestment** in low-probability scenarios.  
- **Underpreparedness** for high-demand shocks.  
- **Suboptimal resource allocation**.  

### **Research Questions**  
1. How sensitive are MILP-driven expansion decisions to demand uncertainty?  
2. Which demand scenarios lead to infeasibility or cost spikes?  
3. Can we derive robust decision rules from sensitivity analysis?  

*(Include a figure here, e.g., a schematic of demand uncertainty vs. expansion costs)*

## 📈 **Methodology**  
### **1. Model Formulation**  
- MILP objective: Minimize total cost (CAPEX + OPEX) subject to capacity constraints.  
- Decision variables: Binary (e.g., build/don’t build) + continuous (e.g., production levels).  

### **2. Demand Uncertainty Modeling**  
- **Scenario-based**: Discrete demand scenarios (low/medium/high).  
- **Probabilistic**: Stochastic programming with sampled distributions.  

### **3. Sensitivity Analysis**  
- **Parameter sweeps**: Vary demand bounds, observe cost/feasibility.  
- **Tornado plots**: Rank parameters by influence on outputs.

## 💻 **Technical Implementation**  
```python
# Pyomo snippet example (simplified)
model = ConcreteModel()
model.x = Var(within=Binary)  # Expansion decision
model.y = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)  # Production
model.cost = Objective(expr=CAPEX*model.x + OPEX*model.y, sense=minimize)
# ... (add your key constraints)
```

## 🔍 **Key Findings**
- 📉 **Demand Sensitivity**:  
  Expansion plans become infeasible beyond **±20%** demand deviation from baseline.

- 💡 **Robustness Insights**:  
  A **15% capacity buffer** reduces cost volatility by **40%** under uncertainty.  

- ⚖️ **Trade-off Analysis**:  
  Phased investments outperform single-stage expansions when demand growth is >**10% CAGR**.
