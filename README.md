## 🌟 **Overview**  
Strategic expansion decisions (e.g., manufacturing capacity, supply chain networks) are often modeled as **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** problems. However, real-world demand uncertainty can significantly alter the feasibility and optimality of these plans. This project:  
- Conducts **sensitivity analysis** on MILP-based expansion models under demand uncertainty.  
- Identifies **critical demand thresholds** that impact investment decisions.  
- Provides **visual tools** to interpret trade-offs between cost, capacity, and risk.

## 🎯 **Motivation & Problem Statement**  
### **Why This Matters**  
Industries face volatile demand due to market shifts, disruptions, or seasonality. Traditional MILP models assume fixed demand, leading to:  
- **Overinvestment** in low-probability scenarios.  
- **Underpreparedness** for high-demand shocks.  
- **Suboptimal resource allocation**.

Expansion decisions in industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, and infrastructure planning require careful assessment of future demand variations. By integrating sensitivity analysis into the MILP framework, we aim to:
- Identify critical parameters affecting expansion feasibility.
- Quantify the impact of demand fluctuations on decision-making.
- Provide insights for robust strategic planning.

### **Research Questions**  
1. How sensitive are MILP-driven expansion decisions to demand uncertainty?  
2. Which demand scenarios lead to infeasibility or cost spikes?  
3. Can we derive robust decision rules from sensitivity analysis?

### **1. Demand Scenario Generation**
We generate multiple demand forecasts using **Monte Carlo simulation**. The simulation considers:
- **User inputs**: Nominal demand data, a set of instructions
- **Real-world dynamics**: Market potential, adoption rates (for new products (NPIs) or cannibalizationeffects), product relationship, launch delays
Scenario sampling is them performed based on cumulative probability functions to ensure comprehensive uncertainty coverage.

### **2. MILP Model Formulation**  
The next step involves formulating a **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model** with the objective of:
- **Minimizing total costs**, including inventory holding and other expenses.
- **Maximizing demand fulfillment** by ensuring optimal capacity allocation.

The model's decision variables determine how many capacity units should be allocated to different work centers over multiple time periods. This results in a **multi-period supply management problem** subject to various constraints, including:
- **Inventory balance** and demand propagation.
- **Production capacity and expansion projects.**
- **Flexible work centers** that can adapt to changing demand.
- **Annual budget limitations** and investment feasibility.

A single demand forecast can be optimized using this MILP model. 

### **3. Sensitivity Analysis**  
To assess how changes in demand parameters affect optimal decisions, we apply a **multi-parametric sensitivity analysis approach**. This method: 
- Provides insights into the impact of demand variations 
- Avoids the need to re-run multiple scenarios
- Determines the sensitivity of decision variables to different demand scenarios, enabling faster and more robust strategic planning.

## 💻 **Technical Implementation**  
```python
# Pyomo snippet example (simplified)
model = ConcreteModel()
model.x = Var(within=Binary)  # Expansion decision
model.y = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)  # Production
model.cost = Objective(expr=CAPEX*model.x + OPEX*model.y, sense=minimize)
# ... (add your key constraints)
```
